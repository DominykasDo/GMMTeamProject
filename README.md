# GMMTeamProject
A repository for the GMM project.

All used code is in the Google colab notebook titled `GMMTeamProject.ipynb`.

This repository contains the `pipeline_zero1to3.py` file used in the notebook (modified to exclude the dependency on `kornia` with an alternative due to incompatability in Google Colab).
